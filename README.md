## R Training 4

This is the 4th R Training document where the aim is to introduce R with a focus on analysing survey data, or data types commonly found in market or strategy research. The document will cover more advanced topics (*advanced* may sound intimidating - but I guarantee they're highly valuable!) in R, including:

- simulating your own data
- for loops
- `apply()` family of functions
- how to write your own custom functions.
